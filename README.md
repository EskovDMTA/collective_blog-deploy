## Photo Blog

Welcome to "Photo Blog" - my educational project created to demonstrate web development skills. Here you can register, publish your photos, comment on posts, like, and interact with other participants.

### About the Project

"Photo Blog" is developed using Ruby on Rails and includes basic social network features such as registration, post publishing, commenting, and liking. The project is created for educational purposes and is intended for learning web development basics. This project is implemented on the educational platform [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/).

It's also worth noting that tests are written in the project using [Minitest](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html). The [Ancestry](https://github.com/stefankroes/ancestry) gem is used for managing comments.
